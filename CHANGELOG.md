## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-10-16

First preview: the core model, a deterministic in-memory runtime and versioned integration contracts.

### Added

- Message taxonomy: `ICommand`, `IDomainEvent`, `IIntegrationEvent` and `[IntegrationEvent(name, Version)]`.
- `Slice<TCommand, TState, TEvent, TError>`: the single owner of a command, separate from the command contract.
- `Publication<TDomainEvent, TIntegrationEvent>`: the explicit boundary from internal facts to public contracts;
  several publications per domain event allow publishing two contract versions during a migration.
- Runtime rules: one owner per command, only integration events can be published from outside,
  integration events exposed separately from domain events (`Published`).
- `Wyrd.Analyzers`, shipped inside the package: message rules (WYRD0001, WYRD0101, WYRD0102) and integration
  event contract snapshots in `contracts.wyrd.txt` with breaking-change detection (WYRD0200–WYRD0204).
- `Upcaster<TFrom, TTo>`: subscribers receive integration events in the contract version they understand, upcast
  step by step; during dual publishing each subscriber gets the fact once.
- IDE code fix for WYRD0200/WYRD0202: writes the suggested line into `contracts.wyrd.txt`.
- Analyzers: one slice per command (WYRD0002), naming suggestions for events and commands (WYRD0003, WYRD0004).

- Process model as data with structural equality and Mermaid rendering.
- Fluent syntax and opt-in pipe syntax (`>>`) building the same process.
- Deterministic `InMemoryRuntime` with a virtual clock: retries for transient faults, compensation in reverse order,
  timeouts, duplicate detection and correlation.
- `samples/Shop`: an order fulfillment process across four vertical slices.
